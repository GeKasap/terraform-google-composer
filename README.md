# Terraform  - Deploy a GCP Composer Environment (managed Airflow)
This project is an implementation of [Terraform Google Composer](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/composer_environment.html)
Layout. Deploys a composer environment and supports installation of additional `Pip` packages.

## How-to
Pre-requisites:
1. Create a Network with firewall rule that allows communication between the cluster nodes on all ports. You can use `terraform-google-network` module.
2. Create a service account with roles `roles/storage.objectViewer`, `roles/container.developer` and `roles/composer.worker`

### Example
```yaml
terraform {
  backend "gcs" {
    bucket  = "my-foo-bucket-tfstate"
    prefix  = "dataproc"
  }

  required_version = ">= 0.12"
}
provider "google-beta" {
  project = "my-foo-project"
  region  = "europe-west3"
  zone = "europe-west3-c"
}

module "my_foo_composer" {
  source = "./terraform-google-composer"
  name = var.composer_name
  project = var.project_id
  region = var.region
  node_count = 3
  zone = var.zone
  network = var.network
  service_account = var.service_account
  machine_type = "n1-standard-1"
}

```

| disk_size_gb | number | The disk size in GB used for node VMs. Minimum size is 20GB. If unspecified, defaults to 100GB. Cannot be updated. | 100  |
| oath_scopes | list(string) | The set of Google API scopes to be made available on all node VMs. Cannot be updated. | ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"]  |
| service_account | string | The service account for the cluster. The service account must have roles/composer.worker | null  |
| use_ip_aliases | bool | Whether or not to enable Alias IPs in the GKE cluster. If true, a VPC-native cluster is created. | null |
| cluster_secondary_range_name | bool | The name of the cluster's secondary range used to allocate IP addresses to pods. Specify either cluster_secondary_range_name or cluster_ipv4_cidr_block but not both. This field is applicable only when use_ip_aliases is true. | null |
| services_secondary_range_name | string | The name of the services' secondary range used to allocate IP addresses to the cluster. Specify either services_secondary_range_name or services_ipv4_cidr_block but not both. This field is applicable only when use_ip_aliases is true. | null |
| cluster_ipv4_cidr_block | string | The IP address range used to allocate IP addresses to pods in the cluster. Set to blank to have GKE choose a range with the default size. Set to /netmask (e.g. /14) to have GKE choose a range with a specific netmask. Set to a CIDR notation (e.g. 10.96.0.0/14) from the RFC-1918 private networks (e.g. 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) to pick a specific range to use. Specify either cluster_secondary_range_name or cluster_ipv4_cidr_block but not both. | null |
| services_ipv4_cidr_block | string | The IP address range used to allocate IP addresses in this cluster. Set to blank to have GKE choose a range with the default size. Set to /netmask (e.g. /14) to have GKE choose a range with a specific netmask. Set to a CIDR notation (e.g. 10.96.0.0/14) from the RFC-1918 private networks (e.g. 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) to pick a specific range to use. Specify either services_secondary_range_name or services_ipv4_cidr_block but not both. | null |
| airflow_config_overrides | map(string) | Apache Airflow configuration properties to override. Property keys contain the section and property names, separated by a hyphen, for example `core-dags_are_paused_at_creation`. | {} |
| pip_packages | map(string) | A space separated list of pip packages to be installed | {} |
| env_variables | map(string) | Additional environment variables to provide to the Apache Airflow scheduler, worker, and webserver processes. Environment variable names must match the regular expression [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*. | {} |
| image_version | string | The version of the software running in the environment. This encapsulates both the version of Cloud Composer functionality and the version of Apache Airflow. It must match the regular expression composer-[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+(\\.[0-9]+)?-airflow-[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+(\\.[0-9]+.*)?.  | composer-1.8.0-airflow-1.10.3 |
| python_version | string | The major version of Python used to run the Apache Airflow scheduler, worker, and webserver processes. | 3 |
| enable_private_endpoint | bool | If true, access to the public endpoint of the GKE cluster is denied. | false |
| master_ip_cidr_block | string | The IP range in CIDR notation to use for the hosted master network.

This range must not overlap with any other ranges in use within the cluster's network. | null  |
| max_node_count | number | Maximum number of nodes of the additional pool | 10  |
| min_node_count | number | Minimum number of nodes of the additional pool | 0  |


## Building
### Initialization

```
$ terraform init
```

### Planning

Terraform allows you to "Plan", which allows you to see what it would change
without actually making any changes.

```
$ terraform plan 
```

### Applying

```
$ terraform apply
```

### Modifying

If you want to update the cluster, then edit the `terraform.tfvars` file and run again `terraform apply`
```
$ terraform apply
```

### Destroying
```
$ terraform destroy
```
